  <p>Big game, on occasions, suffer bitterly through a combination of misfortunes. Something may prevent a herd reaching its best shelter, and it must then endure the storm in poor quarters; pursuit may scatter and leave each one stranded alone in a bad place; in such case each will suffer from lonesomeness, even though it endure the cold and defy enemies. Most animals, even those that are normally solitary, appear to want society during emergencies.</p>
<p>A deep snow is sometimes followed by a brief thaw, then by days of extreme cold. The snow crusts, making it almost impossible for big game to move, but encouragingly easy for wolves to travel and to attack. Of course, long periods separate these extremely deadly combinations. Probably the ordinary loss of big game from wolves and mountain lions is less than is imagined.</p>
<p>Some years ago an old Ute Indian told me that during a winter of his boyhood the snow for weeks lay &ldquo;four ponies deep&rdquo; over the Rocky Mountains, and that &ldquo;most elk die, many ponies die, wolves die, and Indian nearly die too.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Great Snow&rdquo; of this kind is terrible for wild folk.</p>
